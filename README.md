# Boring UI

Boring UI is a simple and minimalist UI library built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI. It's designed to provide a set of basic, well-crafted UI components that you can use to build your applications. Just like the shadcn/ui.

## Why "Boring"?

The name "Boring UI" is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the idea that the best user interfaces are often the most unassuming and straightforward. We believe that the most effective UI components are those that prioritize usability, accessibility, and consistency over flashy design trends.

## Features

- **Tailwind CSS-powered**: Boring UI is built on top of Tailwind CSS, providing a utility-first approach to styling and theming.
- **Radix UI components**: We leverage the well-designed and accessible components from the Radix UI library, including buttons, dropdowns, modals, and more.
- **Minimal and focused**: Boring UI aims to provide a curated set of essential UI components, without the bloat of a larger UI framework.
- **Highly customizable**: You can easily customize the styles and behaviors of the Boring UI components to match your brand and design requirements.
- **Accessible by default**: All Boring UI components are built with accessibility in mind, following best practices for keyboard navigation, screen readers, and more.
